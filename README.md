## Enhancements Beyond Requirements

While the original challenge only required HTML and CSS implementation, I've added several enhancements based on my previous experience:

### JavaScript Functionality

- **Notification System**: Created a success notification that appears when clicking the CTA button
- **Interactive Navigation**: Enhanced the navigation with smooth scrolling and hover effects

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile-First Approach**: Ensured the design works seamlessly across all screen sizes

- **Responsive Typography**: Implemented fluid typography using clamp() for better readability

### Best Practices

- **Semantic HTML**: Used appropriate HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility
- **CSS Organization**: Structured CSS with comments and logical grouping
- **Code Optimization**: Minimized redundancy with CSS variables and reusable components
- **Performance Considerations**: Added lazy loading for images and optimized resource loading

### Animations

- **CSS Animations**: Implemented some common CSS animations to make things more interesting

## Technologies Used
